# simple-blog

Here is a simple blog I created on PHP. 
I used Symfony Framework for this, because I thought without a framework it would take me way too much time to create something decent. 
I implemented most of the things described in the task. Tried not to take too much time. 
I did the task in iterations during the moments when I had free time and tried not to spend too much time on it.
There is a lot of room for improvement: for example a userFactory, which i left as a ToDo. The design should also be improved. 

Here are some screenshots of the blog itself:
